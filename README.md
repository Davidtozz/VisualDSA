</h1>


**VisualDSA** is a web-based visualization tool that allows you to visualize and interact with different data structures and algorithms, helping you to understand them better. 


# Features

- Controlled execution of sorting algorithms (pause/play).
- View source code implementation of a given algorithm/data structure in different programming languages such as C/C++, Java, Typescript and JavaScript

Currently, you can visualize:
- **4 Data Structures**: Linked Lists, Stack, Binary Search Tree (BST), and Graph.
- **5 Sorting Algorithms**: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, 
- **2 Graph Algorithms**: Breadth First Search, Depth First Search.
